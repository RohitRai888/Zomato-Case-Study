place! there are many better places in the vicinity for plantain leaf meal. there was too much of waiting & these staffs were too hurry in serving food & asking people to finish meal & leave quickly. i can understand there is a waiting and staffs should approach in a positive way. i will never go there again!\\\\n\\\\nbangaloreepicure.com\"), (\\'rated 4.0\\', \\'rated\\\\n  i have a confession, being a south indian i distaste south indian food(not that i hate it, i don\\\\\\'t like it either).but still made up my mind on sankaranti to have authentic south indian food visited \"adduri udupi bhojana\" because it was close to my place.i just had a look at the menu told myself that i can do it(i am not blessed with a tremendous appetite).welcomed with the mango soup followed by the wide variety of dishes served, i have developed the new love for pongal(both sweet and khara).i can still feel the taste of the ghee bursting in my mouth but it was\"kai holige\" that made my day, crisp and soft.not to forget food is served on a banana leaf that adds in more flavor and taste.waiters are attentive and responsive.the customer\\\\\\'s needs are monitored and addressed.so much variety

for an authentic south indian food. i personally love being served on banyan leaf. the waiters are all dressed up in traditional mysore attire wearing with a peta. the food was delicious and

10-15 variety types. worth paying for money and you can dine out if you are with more friends/relatives in home.\\'), (\\'rated 4.5\\', \\'rated\\\\n  very good and unlimited . especially masala dosa

exactly like south indian marriage food, 2 soups, sides masala dosa, all were unlimited for just ?150, except ice cream in the end ?? they give a water bottle, and main thing is have patience to get place to sit..... ??,there is no parking place of this outlet, and difficult to park in front of the restaurants,\\')]'"
